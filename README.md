# MM_meadowlarkLC_opensource
Open source micro-manager device adapter for Meadowlark Liquid Crystal controllers.

This project's goal is to collaboratively develop a performant and open-source device adatper for polarization-resolved imaging using Meadowlark's liquid crystal variable retarders.

Originally developed by @amitabhverma at Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA in Rudolf Oldenbourg's laboratory, and released under BSD-3 [license](license_MBL.txt). 

The device adapter is now part of the nightly distribution of Micro-Manager (https://github.com/micro-manager/mmCoreAndDevices/pull/341) and will be maintained there.
