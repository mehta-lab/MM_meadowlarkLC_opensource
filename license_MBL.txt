//
// ToDo List at EOF
//
// Change Log - Amitabh Verma - July 11, 2018
// 1. Removed Activation Key Algo
// Note: Braching for Open Source usage
//
// Change Log - Amitabh Verma - Oct. 10, 2014
// 1. Option for LC - Loaded From File (mmgr_dal_MeadowlarkLC.csv)
// Note: This method will allow providing LCs with custom calibration curve and no further need to recompile this device adapter
// with additional calibration curves.
//
// Change Log - Amitabh Verma - July. 24, 2014
// 1. Replaced ',' comma with ';' semi-colon  in property names due to Micro-Manager warning during HW Config Wizard 'Contains reserved chars'
// Note: This will break Pol-Acquisition (OpenPolScope) and requires compatible version which uses same name for Property
//
// Change Log
// March 19, 2014
// 1. Absolute retardance field
// 2. Extended retardance range to minimum based on voltage and maximum 1.6 waves
// 3. changedTime_ is called only when setting voltage - not for other operations
//
// Feb. 10, 2014
// 1. Added support for D5020 (20V) Controller. Tested with actual unit.
// - Set Max no. of LC based on controller type.
// - Check for no. of Active LCs less than Max
//
// Nov. 21, 2013
// 1. Calibration curves now part of dll and embedded as resource
// - To add more curves add in resource.h and MeadownlarkLC.rc and then add selection case for LC Type and under Initialize()
//
// Nov. 19, 2013
// 1. Added LC Calibration curve selection option
//
// Nov. 18, 2013
// 1. Added scaling based of Controller type (D3050, D3060HV, D5020)
//
// Nov. 14, 2013
// 1. Support for 20V controller - untested (D5020)
// 2. Added TNE support with defaults 20ms pluse duration with 10V/20V Amplitude
// 3. Added Exercise LC Code
// 4a. Added characterization for 10V and 20V range device
// 4b. Implemented range for Voltage and Retardance based on 10V/20V device 
//
// June 27, 2013
// 1. Load calibration curves via csv file
// 2. Generate interpolated calibration curves
// 3. Export calibration curve being used
//
// June 23, 2013
// 1. MeadowlarkLC beta release version 1.0
//
// Apr. 23, 2013
// 1. MeadowlarkLC alpha release version 1.0
//
// Dec. 05, 2012
// 1. Implementing MeadowlarkLC from VariLC device adapter
